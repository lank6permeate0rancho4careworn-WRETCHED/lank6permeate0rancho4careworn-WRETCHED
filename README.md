- 👋 Hi, I’m @lank6permeate0rancho4careworn-WRETCHED
- 👀 I’m interested in ... fields that my username has little or nothing to do with. I will create a list of interests, but it is a list born of a lack of programming knowledge. One keeps bumping into programming languages. So, in this domain of discourse—matters IT, that is, I am interested in the following: I am interested in learning the usual suspects: CSS, JavaScript, perl, Raku/perl 6, python, HTML, HTML5, LaTeX, PGF/TikZ, diagramming (e.g., mermaid, Lucidchart, OmniGraffle), vim, markdown, Mac OS X, iOS, swift, zsh, bash, linux/UNIX, scripting, GitHub, R, regular expressions, regex, granular text editing techniques, working with epub books, Calibre, SQL, TypeScript, and on making this list maybe shorter as I, well, learn to focus!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... PGF/TikZ, mermaidJS, regex/regular expressions, perl, Raku/perl 6, python, JavaScript, more LaTeX, more CSS/HTML, more shell stuff. I am doimg this because I find myself having to.I think it is indicative of my inexperience.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
  - I'm not there, by any means, yet. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
